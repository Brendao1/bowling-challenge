As a bowler,
I want to be able to input my scores

As a bowler,
If I don't strike on the first go,
I want to roll again

As a bowler,
If I knock down 10 pins in the first frame,
I have hit spare and I get bonus points from
the first roll in the next round

As a bowler,
If I knock down 10 pins on the first roll,
I have hit strike and I get bonus points from
both rolls in the next frame
